# Socomo - tend your java code composition 

Socomo is a simple tool to visualize your source code composition and track changes to the
composition as you progress with the development of your java project. Try it now on your code:

```bash
mvn pl.gdela:socomo-maven:display
```

This will open the `socomo.html` file generated by the tool, with visualization of your code
composition within each maven module. Here's an example for Guava:

  <img src="example.gif" alt="Composition of Guava viewed in Socomo">
</p>

To track changes to the composition commit the `socomo.html` file to your source code repository
and add `socomo-maven` plugin to your `pom.xml`. Whenever composition changes the build plugin
will update the human-readable `socomo.html` file, so you'll have a history of changes
in the most convenient place - in your source code repository.

# Maven Plugin

Add this to the `<build><plugins>` section in your `pom.xml` file. For multi-module projects,
you can add it just to the parent pom, and it will be inherited by all modules:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>pl.gdela</groupId>
  <artifactId>socomo-maven</artifactId>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>analyze</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```
